						By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make
						sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or
						modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
						to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into
						other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks,
						copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to
						Recipe Search.
					</Text>
					<Text style={styles.paragraph}>
						Recipe Search is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
						that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at
						any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making
						it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
					</Text>
					<Text style={styles.paragraph}>
						The Recipe Search app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order
						to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.
						We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
						removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
						device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise
						your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Recipe Search app won’t work properly
						or at all.

					<Text style={styles.paragraph}>
						The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.

					<Text style={styles.paragraph}>
						You should be aware that there are certain things that Recipe Search will not take
						responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet
						connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Recipe
						Search cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t
						have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
					</Text>
					<Text style={styles.paragraph}>
						If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of
						the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be
						charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while
						accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
						responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside
						of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not
						the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that
						you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
					</Text>
					<Text style={styles.paragraph}>
						Along the same lines, Recipe Search cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the
						app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
						you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Recipe Search cannot accept responsibility.
					</Text>
					<Text style={styles.paragraph}>
						With respect to Recipe Search’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the
						app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
						correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can
						make it available to you. Recipe Search accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
						you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
					</Text>
					<Text style={styles.paragraph}>
						At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS –
						the requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
						availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to
						keep using the app. Recipe Search does not promise that it will always update the app so that it
						is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your
						device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
						may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
						notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights
						and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
						needed) delete it from your device.
					</Text>
					<Text style={styles.title}>Changes to Terms and Conditions</Text>
					<Text style={styles.paragraph}>
						I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this
						page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
						Conditions on this page.
